**Anjana Cox**

#### Executive summary

#### Rationale
Health and Social Impact
Public Health: Diabetes is a major public health concern, affecting millions of people worldwide. Early prediction and intervention can prevent or delay the onset of diabetes, reducing healthcare costs and improving quality of life.

Preventive Care: By identifying individuals at risk of developing diabetes, healthcare providers can offer targeted preventive measures, such as lifestyle changes or medical interventions, to reduce the likelihood of disease progression.

Personalized Medicine: Machine learning models can help tailor personalized healthcare plans based on an individual's unique risk factors, leading to more effective and efficient treatment strategies.


#### Research Question
"Can we accurately predict the risk of diabetes and prediabetes in individuals using machine learning models based on a set of health indicators and lifestyle factors?"

Specific Objectives:
Prediction Accuracy: How accurately can different machine learning models predict the presence of diabetes or prediabetes using features such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, BMI, smoking status, physical activity, and dietary habits?

Model Comparison: Which machine learning model (Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Random Forest, Decision Tree) performs best in terms of accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score for predicting diabetes risk?

Feature Importance: Which health indicators and lifestyle factors are most significant in predicting diabetes risk, as identified by the machine learning models?

#### Data Sources

#### Methodology
Data Preprocessing
Data Cleaning: Ensuring the dataset is free from missing or erroneous values. This step is crucial for the reliability of the models.
Data Resampling: Addressing class imbalance by upsampling the minority class (individuals with diabetes or prediabetes) to match the number of samples in the majority class.
Feature Engineering
Feature Selection: Choosing relevant health indicators and lifestyle factors as features for the models.
Standardization: Scaling numerical features to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one to ensure that all features contribute equally to the model.
Machine Learning Models
Logistic Regression: A linear model for binary classification, used as a baseline.
Support Vector Machine (SVM): A model that finds the optimal hyperplane for separating classes.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A non-parametric model that classifies based on the majority class of the nearest neighbors.
Random Forest: An ensemble model using multiple decision trees to improve classification performance.
Decision Tree: A tree-based model that splits data based on feature values to make predictions.
Model Evaluation and Hyperparameter Tuning
Grid Search with Cross-Validation: Tuning hyperparameters for each model to optimize performance. Using 5-fold cross-validation ensures that the model generalizes well to unseen data.
Evaluation Metrics: Using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess and compare the performance of each model.
Feature Importance
Logistic Regression Coefficients: Analyzing the magnitude and direction of coefficients to determine feature importance.
Random Forest Feature Importance: Using feature importance scores from the Random Forest model to identify significant predictors.
Visualization and Reporting
Confusion Matrix: Visualizing the performance of each model in terms of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
Bar Plots: Comparing the performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) of all models using bar plots.
Feature Importance Plots: Visualizing the importance of different features as determined by the models.
Implementation Steps
Data Splitting: Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets.
Model Training: Training each machine learning model on the training set.
Model Tuning: Using grid search and cross-validation to find the best hyperparameters.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the models on the test set and comparing their performance.
Feature Analysis: Determining which features are most influential in predicting diabetes risk.
Summary of Methods
Data Preprocessing and Resampling: Ensuring a balanced and clean dataset.
Feature Engineering and Standardization: Preparing data for modeling.
Multiple Machine Learning Models: Employing various models to find the best predictor.
Hyperparameter Tuning and Cross-Validation: Optimizing model performance.
Evaluation Metrics: Comprehensive evaluation using multiple metrics.
Feature Importance Analysis: Identifying key health indicators.
By combining these methods, you aim to develop robust and accurate models for predicting diabetes risk, compare their performance, and identify significant health indicators that contribute to the risk of diabetes.

1. Advanced Modeling Techniques : Ensemble Methods: Explore advanced ensemble techniques such as Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM) and AdaBoost, which often provide superior performance by combining the strengths of multiple models.

2. Model Stacking: Combine predictions from multiple models (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest) to create a meta-model that can improve overall predictive performance.

3. Model Evaluation and Validation: ROC and AUC: Use ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curves and AUC (Area Under the Curve) scores to evaluate and compare model performance more comprehensively.

4. Ethical Considerations: Bias and Fairness: Evaluate your models for potential biases and ensure fairness across different demographic groups. Consider techniques to mitigate any identified biases.
